# Deis Integration Tests

This directory contains [Ginkgo]/[Gomega] based integration tests, which exercise

```console
$ kubectl exec -it deis-workflow-qoxhz python manage.py shell

>>> from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
>>> m = get_user_model()
>>> m.objects.exclude(username='AnonymousUser').delete()
>>> m.objects.all()                                     
```
